# Design Guidelines: Corporate Performance Review Parody Website

## Design Approach: Reference-Based (Playful Corporate Mockery)
**Justification**: This is an experience-focused, visual-rich project that parodies corporate aesthetics while celebrating startup achievements. The design should blend professional corporate styling with playful, celebratory elements.

**Primary Reference**: Corporate performance review systems (Workday, BambooHR) with a satirical twist, enhanced by celebratory product launch aesthetics.

## Key Design Principles

2. **Celebratory Mood**: Bright, positive colors with festive confetti elements
3. **Clear Hierarchy**: Well-organized sections that expand/collapse smoothly
4. **Playful Contrast**: Serious corporate aesthetic with humorous, over-the-top content
5. **Responsive Joy**: Design maintains playful spirit across all device sizes

## Interactive Behavior
- Smooth accordion-style expansion for performance sections
- Gentle hover effects on cards and buttons
- Star rating with subtle animation
- Progressive disclosure of detailed feedback within each section

This design balances professional corporate aesthetics with celebration and humor, creating an engaging parody that honors both corporate culture and startup achievements.
