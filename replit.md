# Corporate Performance Review Parody Website

## Overview

This is a satirical web application that parodies corporate performance review systems while celebrating startup achievements. The project creates a humorous "Unofficial Performance Reviewâ„¢" experience that mimics traditional corporate HR platforms (like Workday or BambooHR) but with a playful, celebratory twist focused on product development milestones and startup culture.

The application presents a single-page performance review interface featuring metrics, ratings, expandable sections, and confetti animations - all designed to blend professional corporate styling with tongue-in-cheek startup celebration aesthetics.
